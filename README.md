# Super-Peach-Sisters
This is a project I created as one of my assignments at UCLA. It functions like Super Mario Bros. However, this time Peach will be the one saving Mario. In this project, we were provided asset files of the characters from our instructor. The level themselves are formatted as text files that can be edited. 

The student (me) was tasked with coding up Actor.h, Actor.cpp, StudentWorld.h, and StudentWorld.cpp with the objective of following good Object Oriented Programming practices.
